# Block_cipher_modes
A program that implements block cipher modes. This program demonstrates the following modes of operation: CBC, CFB,OFB. On top of all it is using CBC residue to implement both integrity and confidentiality in message encryption. This program is using DES algorithm for the encryption implementation.
